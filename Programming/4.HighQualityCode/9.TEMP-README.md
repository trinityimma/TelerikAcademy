## Defensive Programming and Exceptions

For the exercises use the Visual Studio solution "9. Assertions-and-Exceptions-Homework.zip".

1. Add `assertions` in the code from the project **"Assertions-Homework"** to ensure all possible preconditions and postconditions are checked.
* Add exception handling (where missing) and refactor all incorrect error handling in the code from the **"Exceptions-Homework"** project to follow the best practices for using exceptions.
